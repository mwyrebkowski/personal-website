# Using Side Panels for Academic References

This article demonstrates how to implement a side panel system for elegant references, notes, and definitions, similar to academic papers and Gwern's website.

## Introduction

Academic papers often use margin notes or footnotes to provide additional context without interrupting the main text flow. This article shows how to implement a similar feature in a modern web application.

## How It Works

The side panel system uses <span data-def-id="term-component">Term components</span> to define specialized vocabulary. When a reader clicks on a term, its definition appears in the side panel.

## Benefits of Side Panels

Side panels offer several advantages over traditional footnotes:

1. <span data-def-id="non-disruptive">Non-disruptive reading</span>: The reader doesn't need to scroll to the bottom of the page.

2. <span data-def-id="context-preservation">Context preservation</span>: Definitions appear next to the relevant text.

3. <span data-def-id="interactive">Interactive exploration</span>: Readers can choose which terms to investigate.

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses React components with position calculations to align definitions with their corresponding terms. The system handles overlapping definitions by pushing them down in the container.

## Conclusion

Side panels enhance the reading experience by allowing readers to access additional information without disrupting their flow. This approach is particularly valuable for technical or academic content with specialized terminology.
