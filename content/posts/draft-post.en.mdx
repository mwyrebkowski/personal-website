# Sample Draft Post

This is a sample draft post that demonstrates the functionality of our blog platform.

## Introduction

This post should only appear in the admin dashboard and not on the public blog page because it has `published: false` in its frontmatter metadata.

## How It Works

When a post has `published: false`, it will:

1. Be visible in the admin dashboard
2. Be filtered out from the public blog pages in production
3. Only be visible on the public blog in development mode

## Testing

You can use this post to test the proper functioning of the publishing system. If this post appears on your public blog in production, there's an issue with the filtering logic.
