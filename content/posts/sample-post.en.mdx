This is a sample blog post demonstrating the use of marginalia.

Here is some text that includes a term with a definition. You can hover over or click the term <Term targetId="marginalia-example">marginalia</Term> to see its definition, which should appear in the side panel.

The system uses the `<Term>` component, referencing an `id` defined in the post's frontmatter under `definitions`. This allows for structured definitions and commentary alongside the main content. <Term targetId="test">test</Term>
