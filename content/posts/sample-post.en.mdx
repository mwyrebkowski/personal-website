# Sample Published Post

This is a sample published post that demonstrates the functionality of our blog platform.

## Introduction

In this post, I'll explain how the publishing system works.

## How It Works

Our blog posts are written in MDX (Markdown with JSX) which allows us to use React components inside markdown.

This is a Term component: <Term id="term-component" definition="A React component that displays a term with a definition in the side panel.">Term Component</Term>

## Publishing System

Posts with `published: true` in the frontmatter will appear on the public blog.
Posts with `published: false` will only appear in the admin dashboard.

## Conclusion

This post should appear on both the admin dashboard and the public blog page because it has `published: true` in its frontmatter metadata.
